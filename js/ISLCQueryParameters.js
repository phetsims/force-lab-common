  // Enables prototype "self voicing" feature set, which uses the Web Speech API to read content from the sim
  // without the use of a screen reader. This is being tested for the first time in gravity-force-lab-basics, and so this query
  // parameter will be used by the ISLC dependency repos, see https://github.com/phetsims/gravity-force-lab-basics/issues/193
  // The behavior of each value is as follows:
  //  null - No self voicing content (feature disabled)
  //  'paradigm1' - Self voicing content on 'hover' with mouse and keyboard focus, with different levels of verbosity
  //             that can be set by the user.
  //  'paradigm2' - Self voicing content on activation with mouse/cursor for all objects with speakable content, and
  //             self voicing content on focus for interactive things, and on 'click' for non-interactive things.
  //             User can chose between speaking about objects, and whether to include other 'alert' like responses
  //             during simulation changes.
  //  'paradigm3' - Similar to 'levels', but with less non-interactive objects added to the focus order, since
  //                    often information in non-interactive objects can be combined in interactive object descriptions.

  // An additional modification to the self-voicing strings. Value of 1 generally means that strings are entirely
  // custom. value of 2 generally means that strings are sometimes taken directly from the PDOM. Design team wants
  // to custom strings vs PDOM strings. PDOM strings are generally more verbose and so they may be too much
  // for users. Has no impact if selfVoicing query parameter is set to null. Value is of type number because
  // a convention has been established in the design document that these are called "Version 1" and "Version 2".
