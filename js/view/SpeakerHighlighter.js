/**
 * Manages highlights to indicate the state of self-voicing speech, as well as what has self voicing content.
 * Some view componnents will have different highlights while information about the object is being spoken,
 * others will have a unique highlight when the object has focus or when a Pointer is over it to indicate
 * that it has self voicing content.
 *
 * Very rough, prototype code. Uncertain whether this design will be around for a while. But if it does, it
 * would be done in scenery as an overlay presumably (like the FocusOverlay).
